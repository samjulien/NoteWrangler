[Codeschool.com's](http://www.codeschool.com) Soup to Bits for Staying Sharp with Angular.

To do list for extending the tooling and functionality:
* Grunt with JSHint
* Live reload
* Minification
* HTML 5 Push State

I'm also planning on ripping out the front end of this and pairing it with a Rails backend instead of Express just for fun.
